## Usage
Run 'node index.js' to initialize the new game using the constructor. It will then set the contents of /lib/game.js into a new game variable which has a child function called Play which can be accessed using .play(). Furthermore, the files in this game require other files which deconstruct the game down to its basics: the words and letters.
